#Shared data

The original data from Ryskin Et al. is too large to be pushed to the online git repo. Therefore, if you plan on running these analyses, please add a folder here called *Ryskin_original_eyetracking_data*. Then go to *https://osf.io/5geba/* and download all the text files found under *Files > Data and Analysis Rmarkdown > expt2*. If, for some reason, you cannot find the relevant files, feel free to contact Stefan Pophristic to get them (stefan.pophristic@gmail.com).
