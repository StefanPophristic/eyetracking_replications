# Raw MTurk data files

- Batch_2962714_batch_results.csv

A pilot of 24 participants; some demographic information was not recorded possibly because an old version was used


- Batch_2978795_batch_results â€“ practice trials 24 subjects 10-20-17.csv

First batch of 24 participants to make sure that everything works as intended

Long form data without annotation, obtained by running preprocessWideToLong.R

- imprecision_freeprod_oct2017_120participants_long_annotated.csv

Annotated with type of target modification

>> 0 means no modification relating to target adj

>> 1 means target adj is used in positive form; most likely it is the 1st word,
but it can be preceded by some other intersective adjectives,
e.g., horizontal thick line

>> N means the nominal form of the target adj is used, 
e.g., bumpy -> with bumps; spotted -> with spots
bent arrow -> arrow bend; curved line -> curve

Note that some of these might be just typos: e.g., curve arrow

>> C means comparative form of the target adj is used

>> S means superlative form of the target adj is used

>> M means the target adjective is further modified 
e.g., almost straight, mostly empty

>> MS means the superlative form is modified 

e.g., second longest

>> ! means that the response seems obviously wrong, possibly due to misunderstanding or technical errors. If a participant systematically makes such responses we might consider removing them (e.g., participants #44, #65, #76, #103)


>> U means underinformative; possibly due to error  
(the annotation quality on this might be less good because sometimes it is not clear 
whether the description is truly underinformative)

>> A means some sort of antonym is used (rare)
e.g., "flat circle" -> single bump circle


Sometimes it can get tricky: big/large; bent/curved/curvy/curving; thick/wide/fat; antonyms
Right now the standard is quite strict; but the annotation scheme can be further revised
