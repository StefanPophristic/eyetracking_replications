# Intro

Three experiments were run for the Ryskin et al incremental decision task.

The first was run by Casey Butcher in the Summer of 2021. That experiment had several inconsistencies:
- it was only run on one of the two experimental lists in Ryskin et al

The second was run by Stefan Pophristic in Winter of 2022.

The second and third run had the same error: The pragmatic bad conditions in the exposure (training) trials looked identical to the reliable pragmatic condition. This is because the "contrast set present/absent" conditions were interpreted as determining whether there was a contrast set present in the visual scene. This is not the case. In contrast set present unreliable pragmatic condition there was no contrast set present on the screen, and for the contrast set absent reliable pragmatic condition scene there was a contrast set present.

Run 3 was correct but was only ran for the pragmatic unreliable condition.

The final analysis is found in the run 3 folder and uses the following data:
- Pragmatic reliable condition data from run 2
- pragmatic unreliable condition data from run 3
